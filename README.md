# ML Regression and Discriminant Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of various regression and classification techniques as part of a machine learning assignment. The tasks involve experimenting with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and regression techniques including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Non-linear Regression.

## Overview
The main focus of this project is to:
1. Implement LDA and QDA for classification and analyze the decision boundaries.
2. Explore regression techniques, calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE), and compare approaches.
3. Optimize Ridge Regression parameters using gradient descent and analyze the effect of regularization.
4. Experiment with Non-linear Regression using polynomial feature mappings.

### Problem 1: Gaussian Discriminators
- **Functions**: `ldaLearn`, `qdaLearn`, `ldaTest`, `qdaTest`
- **Objective**: Implement and compare LDA and QDA for classification tasks.
- **Results**: Plots of decision boundaries and accuracy comparison.

### Problem 2: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
- **Functions**: `learnOLERegression`, `testOLERegression`
- **Objective**: Minimize squared loss to estimate regression parameters and compare performance with/without intercept.

### Problem 3: Ridge Regression
